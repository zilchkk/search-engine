1.) My apporoach was simple but clear I have to build a search engine as google have where when I'll search it 
will display the result according to the views.It definetly should be innovative sorry for this!

2.) As for the technologies I used is node.js, express.js (for backend), and react.js for (front-end)
I should have used MongoDb for handling the database but in the given I failed inn this thing.

3.) Api: I took Help from google cloud console where I found several APi's(Youtube v3 , custom Api) these are for 
fetching the data to get the video links and article. I also used programmable search engine Api for a 
search Engine ID(It will help to search about blogs and Article)

4.) Management : First I learned a lot by doing this project. API handling , connecting by using CORS and many things fetching data and all
4a.) I made an function regarding the things i have to fetch and with the help of API I fetched the data by using the given URL 
and axios (axios return response.data objects in which it contains the every items of the API) So, I used that objects and 
execute Map function to it to get the items i need for a video and article (such as video.title , article.snnipet).
4b.) As for the frontend I provide the localHost to the axios and it will fetch the data by using Get command
to send whatever the search to the server site.

5.) Most Important Challenges: I'd be very clear the API handling is lot more than I thought of
it's not like its hard but I learned a lot and in future im going to implement a lot of API in my project.
I took help from chat-gpt (not gonna lie its does want a lot improvement). sleep I usually sleep early but 
I want to give my all in this project so I ditched it. Yea this project is eye opening for me because I still have to do lot 
of improvemnt.

6.) Thanks again ! For giving this wonderful project I hope I'll live up to your expectationâœ¨.
